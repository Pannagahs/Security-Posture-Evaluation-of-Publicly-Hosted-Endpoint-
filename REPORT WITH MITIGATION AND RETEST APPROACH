Security Assessment Report â€“ itsecgames.com
1]   Content Security Policy (CSP) Header Not Set
Severity: Medium
Affected: http://www.itsecgames.com/robots.txt

Evidence:

Request: GET http://www.itsecgames.com/robots.txt

Response: No Content-Security-Policy header present

ZAP Reference: CWE-693, OWASP 2021 A05
Description:
CSP is a browser feature designed to reduce cross-site scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks by restricting resource loading to trusted sources. Without CSP, attackers can inject malicious scripts, deface the site, or perform phishing/malware delivery.
Impact:
Increased exposure to XSS and injection-based attacks.
Remediation:
Configure server to send Content-Security-Policy header LIKE EG: 

Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self';
THEN RE-RUN THE SAME-- curl -I http://www.itsecgames.com

2]  Missing Anti-clickjacking Header

Severity: Medium
Affected: http://www.itsecgames.com/

Evidence:
Request: GET http://www.itsecgames.com/

Response: No X-Frame-Options or CSP frame-ancestors directive set
Description:
Clickjacking allows attackers to trick users into interacting with hidden UI elements (e.g., clicking a hidden "Buy" or "Approve" button). Missing protection headers increase risk of UI redress attacks.
Impact:
Attackers can embed the site in a malicious frame, hijacking user actions.
Remediation:
Set one of the following headers: 
Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'none';
OR 
X-Frame-Options: DENY

Retest:
Re-run curl -I http://www.itsecgames.com

3]  X-Content-Type-Options Header Missing

Severity: Low
Affected: http://www.itsecgames.com/

Evidence:

Request: GET http://www.itsecgames.com/

Response: No X-Content-Type-Options header
Description:
This header prevents MIME-sniffing by browsers. Without it, some browsers may incorrectly interpret files, leading to XSS risks.
Impact:
Attackers may craft payloads that bypass content-type restrictions.
Remediation:
Add:
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff

Retest:
Use curl -I http://www.itsecgames.com | grep -i x-content-type-options.

4]  Missing Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)

Severity: Medium
Affected: https://itsecgames.com
 (443)
Evidence:

Command: curl -s -D - -o /dev/null https://itsecgames.com | sed -n '1,120p'

Output: No Strict-Transport-Security header
Description:
HSTS enforces HTTPS-only connections and prevents SSL stripping attacks. Its absence leaves users vulnerable to downgrade and man-in-the-middle attacks.
Impact:
Attackers on the same network may intercept or downgrade HTTPS connections.
Remediation:
Add header:
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload

Retest:
Run: curl -I https://itsecgames.com | grep -i strict-transport-security.
