Objectives with Respect to Report

Identify vulnerabilities on the domain
The ZAP scan of http://www.itsecgames.com identified 3 main vulnerabilities:
Content Security Policy (CSP) Header Not Set (Medium risk)
Missing Anti-clickjacking Header (Medium risk)
X-Content-Type-Options Header Missing (Low risk)

Detect potential vulnerabilities (misconfigurations, outdated software, CVEs)
The detected issues are security misconfigurations related to missing HTTP response headers.
These fall under OWASP Top 10: Security Misconfiguration categories and are not CVEs but misconfiguration vulnerabilities

Assess SSL/TLS configuration and certificate health
The ZAP report scanned only the HTTP site (http://), so SSL/TLS assessment was not included in this report.
A separate tool like SSLyze or OpenSSL would need to be run on https://itsecgames.com to cover this objective.

Highlight exposed information that could aid attackers (headers, banners, error messages)
ZAP revealed that the server did not send crucial security headers: CSP, Anti-clickjacking, and X-Content-Type-Options.
This lack of headers increases exposure to attacks such as XSS, Clickjacking, and MIME-sniffing.
The server banner shows Apache, which reveals the backend software version family (information disclosure).

Provide a prioritized list of findings with mitigation recommendations
Medium severity (Higher Priority):
CSP Header Not Set → Add a Content-Security-Policy header.
Missing Anti-clickjacking Header → Add X-Frame-Options: DENY or use CSP frame-ancestors.
Low severity (Lower Priority):
X-Content-Type-Options Missing → Add X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff.
This prioritization aligns with standard vulnerability management (focus on Medium risks first).
